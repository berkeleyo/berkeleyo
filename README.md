## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Cloud engineer focused on **access governance**, **secure network architectures**, and **pragmatic automation**. I like clean runbooks, reversible cutovers, and evidence-first security. I work primarily in **Azure**, with complementary projects in **AWS** and **GCP** where they deliver value.

- 🛡️ Identity & Access: JIT elevation, Conditional Access, PIM, external‑ID federation (Azure • AWS STS • GCP WIF)
- 🌐 Networking: Fortinet SD‑WAN/IPsec in Azure, HA/BGP, MTU optimization
- ⚙️ Automation: PowerShell/Bicep, Logic Apps, YAML pipelines, GitHub/Azure DevOps
- 📊 Ops: Runbooks, cutover/rollback, observability, backup verification
- ✍️ Documentation: concise, production‑ready, redacted
