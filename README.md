# Berkeley — Cloud Engineer ☁️

I build and maintain scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud platforms on **Microsoft Azure**.  
My focus areas include **Infrastructure-as-Code**, **automation**, **network architecture**, **security operations**, and **governance**.  
I deliver production-ready solutions that are modular, testable, and easy to hand over.
